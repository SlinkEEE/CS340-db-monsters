This sample application requires the database dump to be setup *before* you can run the application -- otherwise you won't be able to get past the index page. The DDQ file contains definitions and some sample data to populate the tables.

To run:
- Set up DB and/or use OSU VPN
- Place files in local directory
- Edit dbcon.js to connect to your database
- npm install
- node main.js XXXX, where "XXXX" is a port number of your choice
